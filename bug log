bugs:


0 search results should maybe trigger a refresh OR not overwrite current reviews array, only showing message modal

text and rating-display dont scale  well

in heroku - new post does not refresh page

mobile responsiveness? change width values in the @media section

8/13
	fixed - flash message font should match form font
	fixed - .home route - Changed it to '/' - need to test on heroku
	added - ' n results for "search query" ' flash message
	refactored - created AppContext for state that is basically global
	refactored - open/close modal methods cut, just using one setter method

8/9
fixed - new review should alert when failed - added form validation for title and image
fixed - file input should only accept jpeg, png


8/6
fixed for now - styling on forms and modals should be more polished
fixed - edit form should focus() on top of page - window.scrollTo(0, 0);

8/1
fixed- intersection observer should deactivate when search results are returned 
	scrollLoading is a new state value that determines if the observer will load anything
	it actually sets the current page to -1, which ends the scrolling progress

fixed- delete / edit buttons only show to correct user

added- reviews appear in newest to oldest order

fixed - edit form half icons

fixed - new and edited posts do not update in DOM until reload.
	New or Edit submit will reset reviews and page counter, triggers fetch from the start

fixed - edit form - image.data is null
fixed - search doesnt convert image to dataurl

fixed - validate logins on appropriate routes

fixed - create new post should display 'need to log in' message if not logged in
fixed - textarea in post/edit form
8/4
fixed - delete function and review deleted message

fixed - delete review needs a confirm button
